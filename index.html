        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>I started my journey in cybersecurity as a curious learner fascinated by how the web works. 
           Over time, I became interested in bug bounty hunting and ethical hacking, focusing on finding 
           vulnerabilities that can improve security for companies and users alike.</p>

        <h4>Skills</h4>
        <p>My skills include web security, reconnaissance techniques, and vulnerability assessment. 
           I practice scripting with Python and Bash to automate tasks and improve efficiency. 
           Currently, I’m diving deeper into XSS, SQLi, and authentication bypass vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>My main goal is to expand my knowledge and contribute actively to bug bounty programs. 
           I want to sharpen my reporting skills, improve my methodology, and collaborate with 
           security communities. Long-term, I aim to specialize in application security 
           and penetration testing.</p>
